Activity 1 (10 mins)
In your groups, discuss the following questions about the above scenario. Write your answers in your journals:
1. Storage and Accessibility: Explain why it is important to store and organise your files
efficiently. (2-3 sentences)
Efficient storage and organization make it easier for team members to search for, share and update files without confusion. It also reduces the risk of data loss, duplication or mismanagement, which is crucial in large, multi-format research projects.

2. File Storage Methods: Explain your methods for storing the different types of data in
the scenario. Specify which data types may require special access controls.
I will use a structured folder system to separate literature, quantitative data, qualitative data and reports. Sensitive documents, such as consent forms and interview records, should be subject to restricted access, while general documents, such as literature reviews, can be widely accessed.
